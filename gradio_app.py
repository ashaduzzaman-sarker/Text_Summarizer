The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds. The U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze medal. Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, having previously won the 100m and 200m races in the Russian capital. "I'm proud of myself and I'll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible," Bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics. Victory was never in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade, while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam failed to get the baton away cleanly. Earlier, Jamaica's women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who like Bolt was completing a triple.""",

The lithium-metal battery uses a solid electrolyte instead of the traditional liquid version, making it safer and more energy-dense. Researchers claim the new batteries can store up to twice as much energy as current lithium-ion batteries while charging in half the time. The technology could extend electric vehicle range to over 500 miles on a single charge and reduce charging times to under 15 minutes. The team expects commercial production to begin within three years, potentially transforming the automotive industry and accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation.""",
